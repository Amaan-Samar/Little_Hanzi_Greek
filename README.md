Little hanzi Greek is a nice simple that i created to make Greek learning process simple efficient and clean. It teches Greek via read articles. I was looking for something similar solution in the open source solution, and could not find any so i decided to create this for myself. Latter on i made it pubic so that if there is some else stuck in the same problem as me, They can use it.
